## cfmortality
Allows clinicians to predict 1- and 2- year risk of death (with  a threshold risk of death of >= 20% for the 1-year model) in cyctic fibrosis patients based on patients' overal health status described in [https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/54/3/1900224](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/54/3/1900224).


### Installation
You can install the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.package("remotes")
remotes::install_github("resplab/cfmortality")
```

### Mortality Prediction

To get a prediction for mortality rate for first and second year , you will need to pass in patient's risk factors. For example: 

```
predictcfmortality (age = 16, male = 0, fvc = 66.7, fev1 = 47.4, fev1LastYear = 80.5, bcepacia = 0, underweight = 0, nHosp = 0, pancreaticInsufficient = 1, CFRelatedDiabetes = 0, ageAtDiagnosis = 0.9)

```

The **predictcfmortality()** function returns 1- year and 2-year mortality rate of patients with cystic fibrosis with 20% cut-off for risk of death of the 1-year model.

### Cloud-based API Access
The [Peer Models Network](https://www.peermodelsnetwork.com) allows users to access `cfmortality` through the cloud. Fore more info please refer to the [PRISM model repository](https://models.peermodelsnetwork.com).

#### R

In R, you can use package [`peermodels`](https://github.com/resplab/peermodels) to access the API.

```
remotes::install_github (resplab/peermodels)
library(peermodels)
connect_to_model("cfmortality", api_key = YOUR_API_KEY)
input <- get_default_input()
results <- model_run(input)
```

#### Linux

In Ubuntu, you can call the API with `curl`:

```
curl \
-X POST \
-H "x-prism-auth-user: REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"func":["prism_model_run"],"model_input":[{"male": 0,"age": 57,"fvc": 66.7,"fev1": 47.4,"fev1LastYear": 80.5,"bcepacia": 0,"underweight": 0,"nHosp": 0,"pancreaticInsufficient": 1,"CFRelatedDiabetes": 0,"ageAtDiagnosis": 0.9}]}' \
https://prism.peermodelsnetwork.com/route/cfmortality/run
```
