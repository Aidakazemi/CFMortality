# CFMortality
R package for predicting 1- and 2- year risk of death (with  a threshold risk of death of >= 20% for the 1-year model) in cyctic fibrosis patients based on patients' overal health status described in [https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/54/3/1900224](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/54/3/1900224)


## Installation
The lastest stable version can be downloaded from CRAN:

```
install.package ('CFMortality')
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("resplab/CFMortality")
```

# Web App for CFMortality

CFMortality is also available as a web app, accessible at [http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/CFMortality](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/CFMortality)

### Mortality Prediction

To get a prediction for mortality rate for first and second year , you will need to pass in patient's risk factors. For example: 

```
predictCFMortality (age = 16, male = 0, fvc = 66.7, fev1 = 47.4, fev1LastYear = 80.5, bcepacia = 0, underweight = 0, nHosp = 0, pancreaicInsufficient = 1, CFRelatedDiabetes = 0, ageAtDiagnosis = 0.9)

```

The **predictCFMortality()** function returns 1- year and 2-year mortality rate of patients with cystic fibrosis with 20% cut-off for risk of death of the 1-year model.

## Cloud-based API Access
The [PRISM platform](http://prism.resp.core.ubc.ca) allows users to access CFMortality through the cloud. A MACRO-enabled Excel-file can be used to interact with the model and see the results. To download the PRISM Excel template file for CFMortality please refer to the [PRISM model repository](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/prism).
